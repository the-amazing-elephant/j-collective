## j-collective

j-collective is a collaborative space (a [stone stoup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)) for sharing, discussing, critiquing and appreciating Japanese content.

## Tenets

- Mistakes are appreciated, dissected and reconstructed into something beautiful
- Confidence is built through finding comfort in the discomfort
- Exposure is attained by taking the plunge into a wide range of topics

## Format

Everyone in the group brings a snippet of content to the stonepot. The content could be anything - [lyrics to a song](https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/231636/lyrics/I093661/), [a blog post](https://tech.smarthr.jp/entry/2019/04/26/173957) or even an extract from the [Japanese constitution](http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_annai.nsf/html/statics/shiryo/dl-constitution.htm).

A typical round for each piece of content will have:

- A five minute reading by the learner who contributed the content
- Pre-determined questions put out to the rest of the group. Either:
  1. Each learner writes down their answers within 5 minutes and each one then presents their answers in succession or
  2. The learners have a group discussion on the questions asked
- Translation challenge - The learner unleashes a sentence in the source language that everyone in the group has a minute (or less) to translate. At the end of the minute, the results are collated and the learners vote for the most ideal translation.

## Preparation

Every learner should ideally compile the following into a document and make it available to share with the rest of the group.

- The entire extract with the source
- Vocabulary list with meaning
- Kanji list with meaning (doesn't need to have all readings mentioned - only the reading in the text is plenty)


## Tech Interaction

- Learners vote in the translation challenge through a simple web app running in the browser
- A lapel mic is attached to each learner and everything is recorded and made available online
